# ANTIGRAVITY.md - Antigravity Configuration for Social Flow

## 🎯 Project Context

**App:** Social Flow
**Stack:** React + Vite + Framer Motion
**User Level:** Level A (Vibe-Coder) - _Explain the "why" simply._

## 📋 Directives

1.  **Master Plan:** Always read `AGENTS.md` first to check the current roadmap.
2.  **Documentation:** Refer to `agent_docs/` for specific patterns (especially `layoutId` usage).
3.  **Plan-First:** Before writing code, say: "Here is the plan for [Scene Name]..."
4.  **Incremental Build:** Build ONE scene at a time.
5.  **Visual Polish:** If the user says "make it pop," suggest adding `box-shadow`, `scale` on hover, or `backdrop-filter`.

## 🛠 Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start the presentation server
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run preview` - Test the production build (Crucial for performance checks)

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT delete files without asking.
- Do NOT suggest complex routing libraries (we use conditional rendering).
- Do NOT use online CDNs for images.
