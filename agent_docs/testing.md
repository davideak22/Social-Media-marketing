# Verification Strategy

## Manual Checks (The Vibe Check)

1.  **The Clicker Test:** Can you navigate the whole deck using ONLY the spacebar?
2.  **The "Jank" Test:** Do animations stutter? (If yes, ask AI to "promote to GPU layer").
3.  **The Airplane Test:** Turn off Wi-Fi. Does the app still load and play videos?

## Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] No `any` types in TypeScript.
- [ ] No external URLs in `src`.
- [ ] Images are optimized (WebP preferred).
