# Project Brief (Persistent Rules)

- **Product Name:** Social Flow
- **Vision:** A "Keynote-killer" presentation that feels like a movie, not a slideshow.
- **Design Vibe:**
  - **Dark Mode:** Black backgrounds, white text.
  - **Glassmorphism:** Subtle `backdrop-blur` on overlays.
  - **Motion Meaning:** Elements morph to show context (e.g., a card _becomes_ the full screen view).
- **Hardware:** Optimized for Chrome on a Desktop/Laptop connected to a 1080p Projector.
- **Input:** Must support physical clickers (which map to ArrowLeft/ArrowRight).
